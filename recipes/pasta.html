    <li>

      <ul>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Making the Garlic Parmesan Sauce:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the minced garlic to the skillet and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant, 
          being careful not to burn it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the heavy cream and stir well. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning according to your preference.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Combining the Pasta and Sauce:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet with the garlic Parmesan sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss the pasta gently to coat it evenly with the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue cooking over low heat for 2-3 minutes, 
          allowing the pasta to absorb some of the sauce and heat through.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the sauce thickens too much, you can add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Serving:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfer the creamy garlic Parmesan pasta to serving plates or bowls.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh chopped parsley for a pop of color and added freshness.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately as a main dish or alongside a crisp salad and garlic bread for a complete meal.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
