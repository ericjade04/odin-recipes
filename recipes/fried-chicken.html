  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken</li>
    <li>2 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Procedures</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>Marinating the Chicken</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, place the chicken pieces and pour buttermilk over them. 
          Ensure the chicken is completely coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results. 
          This step helps to tenderize the meat and enhance the flavors.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Preparing the Coating:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In a shallow dish, 
          combine the all-purpose flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, 
          and cayenne pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of the seasonings.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Coating the Chicken:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade, allowing any excess to drip off.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, pressing gently to help 
          the coating adhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the coated chicken on a baking sheet or wire rack and allow it to rest for 15-20 minutes. 
          This helps the coating set before frying.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Frying the Chicken:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a large skillet or deep frying pan, pour enough vegetable oil to submerge the 
          chicken pieces partially.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350°F (175°C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully place a few chicken pieces into the hot oil, 
          being cautious not to overcrowd the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry the chicken for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. 
          Larger pieces may require additional cooking time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once cooked, transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain 
          any excess oil.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Serving:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Serve the fried chicken hot as a main dish or as part of a hearty meal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accompany it with your favorite side dishes like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, cornbread, 
          or a fresh salad.
        </li>
